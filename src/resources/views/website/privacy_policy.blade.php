            </ul>

            <p>We will only use your personal data for a reason other than the purpose for which

                purpose and have a legitimate interest in doing so. </p>

                <br>

            <h5 class="text-1xl font-bold" >Disclosure of your information </h5>

            <p>There are a range of circumstances where we may disclose your data to third

                (ii) our suppliers who may be involved in the fulfilment of our services to you

            <h5 class="text-1xl font-bold" >Controlling the use of your data </h5><br>

            <h5 class="text-1xl font-bold" >Data storage and the transfer of your data </h5>

            <p>As part of the services offered to you, for example through our Website, the
                information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in countries
                outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) as we may use remote website server
                hosts to provide the website and some aspects of our service, which may be based
                outside of the EEA, or use servers based outside of the EEA. It may also be
                processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers,
                e.g. our website server host, or work for us when temporarily outside of the
                EEA. </p>

            <p>If we transfer or store your personal data outside the EEA in this way, we will
                take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be
                protected, as outlined in this privacy policy. Where we use suppliers based in
                the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield
                which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
                between Europe and the US. </p><br>

            <h5 class="text-1xl font-bold">Security </h5>

            <p>We take the confidentiality of personal information very seriously and use
                recognized security and access controls to protect the information from
                unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration or corruption. We have procedures
                and processes in place to ensure that your personal information is managed
                appropriately. </p>

            <p>However, we will always recommend that you take your own precautions to protect
                your own personal data whilst using the Internet, including this website.
            </p><br>

            <h5 class="text-1xl font-bold">Data retention </h5>

            <p>The length of time that we retain, and store data depends on the purpose for
                which it was collected. </p>

            <p>We will delete immediately recruiting information if the candidate is not
                selected for the job or if he or she didn&rsquo;t give consent for The Grant
                Portal to keep the information 2 years in case of new opportunities. </p>

            <p>We keep 3 years data shared during demo request conversation. </p>

            <p>We keep some types of cookies up to 24 months </p>

            <p>Where you have requested that we provide you with marketing materials we will
                retain your data until such time as consent is withdrawn by you. </p>
